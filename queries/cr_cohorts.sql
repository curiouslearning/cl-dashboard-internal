-- =====================================================================================
-- Nightly sticky cohort upsert (multi-cohort + derived app cohorts)
--
-- Table: dataexploration-193817.user_data.cr_cohorts
-- Schema: (cr_user_id STRING/INT64, cohort_name STRING)
--
-- Behavior:
-- - Sticky: inserts new (cr_user_id, cohort_name) pairs; never removes existing rows
-- - Deterministic user base: picks exactly 1 row per cr_user_id (highest max_user_level, then latest last_event_date)
-- - Program cohorts: add/edit definitions in cohort_rules below (prefixed "program:")
-- - App cohorts: for any user with app != 'CR', inserts cohort_name = CONCAT('app:', app)
-- - MERGE prevents duplicates for (cr_user_id, cohort_name)
